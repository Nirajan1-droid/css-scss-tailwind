              grid-column:1/3; here 2 columns are there.
              but the grid-end-column  is 3 because, the top to bottom of the left is refered as 1 and moved 2 column accross so,end becomes 3 

            grid-column : 1/-1 
            from the first column to last column
             because the -1 represents the end of the column

             #now grid row:
                grid-row : 1/3
                from first row to the 3rd row.
